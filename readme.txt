FOLDER#1; GPR raw data
	
This folder contains the GPR data profiles collected during the experiment.
Pulse Ekko Sensor and Software instrument used during data collected.
Each profile labeled with
-experimental cell number (6),
-time of the data collection as "before" or "after" the fracture creation,
-direction of the data collection (East to West)
-and the profile number 

i.e. "cell6_after_EtoW_4"
The file extentions HD and DT1 are the header and data files respectively.

FOLDER#2; 3D GPR picking

This folder contains data files (all the profiles combined accordingly)
for before and after the fracture creation, and Matlab codes and functions to
pick the target reflections.

FOLDER#3; Figures

This folder contains the Matlab codes developed to create all three figures 
presented in this manuscript and the data files needed.
